Individual Coursework for Neural Computing by Chris Chow

Abstract:
The experiment is carried out to compare the LSTM and RNN architectures with time series data that carries seasonality, trend, and irregular pattern. The LSTM has shown great prediction power when trying to predict the S&P 500 index during the time in pandemic which shows instabilities. RNN demonstrated its outstanding computational performance for fast training with losing too much prediction performances.
